# Introduction

This is the repository for an intensive JavaScrip skill development based on a ["120 Days Plan"](http://lenafaure.com/2017/08/05/become-better-front-end-developer/) That I found promising to follow.
I have modified parts of the plan in order to include the most recent in-demand knowledge of JavaScript.

## Procedure

The codes will be examined to see if there is a possibility of refactoring the code or updating deprecated features that have been used in the original codes.
